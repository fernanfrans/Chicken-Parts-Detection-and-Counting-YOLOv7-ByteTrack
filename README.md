# 🐔Chicken Parts Detection and Counting using YOLOv7 and ByteTrack

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an AI-powered system for detecting and counting chicken parts in images and videos using **YOLOv7** for object detection and **ByteTrack** for object tracking. A simple algorithm is used for counting objects that cross a predefined line.

## 🚀 Features
- **YOLOv7** for real-time object detection.
- **ByteTrack** for multi-object tracking.
- **Custom line-crossing algorithm** for counting detected objects.
- **Video processing support** for live detection and tracking.
